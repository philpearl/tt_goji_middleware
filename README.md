# Some Goji middleware

Some simple Goji middleware I've found useful.

## What's included

- Set something in Context for all requests.  For example global configuration or a database connection pool
- Error catching and reporting
- Logging ('fraid I don't like the Goji version)
- A very simple GZIP
